              I'm a <em>Caltech</em> class of 24' Computer Science major. I've worked as a <em>software engineer</em> at
              a number of companies including <em>Palantir,</em> the <em>CoStar Group</em> and <em>JPL</em>.

              While my summer internships have taught me the most, I also enjoy competing in hackathons and practicing
              during the school year as well. The last two years, I've won both <em>First Overall</em> and <em>HRT's
              Best Use of Data</em> awards at <em>Hacktech</em>, Caltech's annual international hackathon. My two
              submissions were an auction based food marketplace <em>Foodbridge</em> and a novel social media app <em>Reach Out</em> designed to bring old friends back in touch.
              Both projects taught me a lot, notably about the importance of research, presentation, and business feasibility
              alongside technical skills.

              Outside of academics, I love running both cross country and

              <span class="books">Running With the Buffaloes</span>. Other than that, I relax by hanging out with family and friends.

              This summer I built an event aggregation system on Palantir's geo-spatial analysis application.
              It tracks artifact changes and consolidates them for users allowing granular review of events in
              the document. I also built an extension of the filtering system for artifact events giving users the power
              to drill down and isolate their changes more easily. I worked <em>full-stack</em> using Java in the back-end
              and TypeScript in the front-end.

              I lead office hours to help students debug code and go more in-depth on course material. While the
              course focuses on teaching <em>object-oriented</em> programming (through Python and Java), we also
              put considerable emphasis on developing good <em>coding fundamentals</em> through unit-testing, documentation,
              and readability. Our goal is to prepare students for collaborative coding and giving them practical skills
              to apply to all fields of study. I also contribute to the course design as we take strides towards 
              integrating more project-based assignments and making the class more inclusive.

              for our pricing assembly.

            <p>
              The goal of Foodbridge is to make a sustainable, business-driven marketplace that distributes
              surplus food from producers to consumers in need. Billions of dollars worth of food is discarded
              every year, but people around the world live in poverty and hunger. While the idealism of 
              connecting these two groups is obvious, we wanted to take a shot at making this a reality through
              a project rooted in capitalism. By making an auction system connecting producers, consumers, and 
              drivers, we connect supply with demand while also handling the logistical troubles of transportation.
              This project won <em>HRT's Best Use of Data</em> award at Hacktech 2023.

              Anagrams takes the classic Game Pigeon game and ports it into a web application.
              Scoring calculations and word possibilities are generated in <em>Python</em> and 
              interact with the web page through <em>Flask</em>. Players can customize number of
              letters, choose unique timers, and keep track of their standings with an updating
              leaderboard. The game also shows players which words they missed and other possibilities
              after the game ends.

              One of my first personal projects, I combined my love of software and fantasy
              basketball. Leveraging <em>NumPy</em>, I used statistical analysis to predict
              player output by following historical progressions and unique player progressions.
              In many ways, the model is very reminiscent of machine learning, which I only
              realized after I took more courses! Through <em>Flask</em> I ported this to a 
              web application that over <em>2000 players</em> used for their drafts last year.
